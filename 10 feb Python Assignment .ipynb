    "In Python, the open() function is used to open a file. It takes two arguments: the file name and the mode in which the file should be opened.<br>\n",
    "There are several modes of opening a file in Python, which are as follows:<br>\n",
    "'r': This mode is used to open a file for reading. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file, and if the file does not exist, an error is raised.<br>\n",
    "'w': This mode is used to open a file for writing. If the file exists, its contents are truncated. If the file does not exist, a new file is created.<br>\n",
    "'x': This mode is used to open a file for exclusive creation. If the file already exists, an error is raised.<br>\n",
    "'a': This mode is used to open a file for writing in append mode. The file pointer is placed at the end of the file, and if the file does not exist, a new file is created.<br>\n",
    "'b': This mode is used to open a file in binary mode.<br>\n",
    "'t': This mode is used to open a file in text mode.<br>\n",
    "'+': This mode is used to open a file for updating (reading and writing)."

These resources are finite, so it's important to release them when they are no longer needed.
